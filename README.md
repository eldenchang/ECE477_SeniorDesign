## This is the repo for our project firmware.

We are using Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52832 microcontroller as the main controller of our programmable mechanical keyboard. 
This repo is based on the [Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52 SDK version 15.2.0](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/download_resource/59012/94/63298856/116085), since we are using a lot of the files in the SDK.
We never used nRF452 microcontroller before so we started to code the firmware based on the ble_app_hids_keyboard example in the SDK.
We will reorganize this repo as a independent project firmware as soom as we finish implementing the main functions of our project.
